 Starbase Version 3 Release Notes:

 NEW Simpler Tables Format, backward compatibility retained.

 The original starbase release in 1994...   Followed the /rdb tables format

 Most user tables do not benifit from strict tabbed tables, most "data"
 columns contain only a single value with out embeded spaces.

 Users may set the NICE flag to enable whitespace delimited columns.
 If a table header has fewer column names than a row has columns
 all of the trailing text is placed in the last columns.


 1. Strict tables by default.

 2. Program parsing mode set with flags option to table_header routine.

    A program can request nice or strict parsing of its input.

 3. Global parsing mode set with "STARBASE_TAB" environment variable.

    The user can get nice tab tables for all thier starbase programs by 
    setting an environment variable.

	setenv STARBASE_TAB NICE
	or
	setenv STARBASE_TAB STRICT

 4. Table parsing mode set by "TAB" table header keyword.

    A Table can tell the program that is reading it how it wants to be parsed.

	TAB	NICE
	or
	TAB	STRICT
