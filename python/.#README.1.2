xlsx2table.py uses the python "openpyxl" excel spreadsheet reader/writer module.  You
may need to install this package.  This installation command worked for me:

INSTALL
-------

    > easy_install openpyxl

    > cp xlsx2table $BIN/xlsx2table
    > ln -s $BIN/xlsx2table $BIN/table2xlsx

xlsx2table reads a matrix of cells from an excel xlsx spreadsheet and prints a 
starbase table to the standard out.

    usage: xlsx2table file.xlsx sheet cell0[:cell2] [-data]

    The program takes an input file name, the sheet name and a cell range to
    extract a table from.  The first row of the table is taken as the head row.
    The values in the header row have all characters not in [a-zA-Z0-9_] removed.
    If the -data switch is specified a plain matrix of data values is output
    without a starbase header.

    If only the first cell in the desired cell range is specified the spreadsheet
    the first row/column is searched down/right from that cell until an empty 
    cell is encountered.


table2xlsx reads a starbase table from the standard input and writes it into a 
range of cells in an xlsx spreadsheet.

    usage: table2xlsx file.xlsx sheet cell0

    The program read a starbase table from the standard input and writes it to 
    a range of cells in an xlsx spreadsheet.  If the spreadsheet already exists 
    the cell values are updated with new values from the input table.  If the 
    named sheet does not exist it will be created.
