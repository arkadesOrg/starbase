1.  Updated imhhdr to comment out special code at the end to skip "COMMENT"
buffers - it broke with the BTC data.  It looks like this "else" condition
is no longer up to date with the "if" half and the COMMENT value
appears after the filename and before all the keywords.
				
2.  Initialzed the 4 buffers (labptr,hdrptr,delptr, etc) after each
salloc.  This was probably REALLY the issue up above.
