 Join on N columns - specify sort order as in sorttable
 Join N files

 Add simplexfittable
	Fix up cprodtable

 Headers
    Add type/units/format specifications to the table columns
      Information lines could be sandwitched between the headline/ dashline
      pair.  These are just "inverted" keyword - value arrays stored in a way
      to empahsize thier coorspondence to the columns they describe.

	    X    	Y	Z
	    double	double	double	type
	    %6g 	%6g	%6g	format
	    mm  	mm	mm	units
	    --  	--	--
	    <data>
	    ...

    Accept TABLEHEADERCHAR in the environment.

 Search
     Search needs one more pass of optimization.  Currently the search
     runs in the order specified on the command line.  The search descriptors
     should be organized in a list that can be sorted by various factors.

     During a search with multiple input key rows the results of the previous
     search can be used to guide the execution of the next.  In addition the
     index file for a particular column might contain information about the 
     distribution of the indexed data.  This way the number of rows resulting
     from a particular search could be (roughly) predicted.

    Search Optimization

	    Homiginize search and filter
	    Push sequential search off as filter
	    Mini language to build complex search expr.

	    Search functions:

		box(Xcol, Ycol, X, Y, width [, height])
		circle(Xcol, Ycol, X, Y, radius);

		radecunits(RA, Dec, units)

		radecbox(Rcol, Dcol, RA, Dec, width [, height])
		radeccircle(Rcol, Dcol, RA, Dec, radius)


  Record Locking

	Offset	Length
	-	-

	locktable	file	< records
	unlocktable	file	< records

    Add record location output to search

    Record update by Offset

	table_rowupdate(file, offset, row, space)
